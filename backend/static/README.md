# Static assets layout

Use these folders to keep assets organized and predictable.

- `backend/static/landing/` — landing page images and background art
- `backend/static/ui/` — UI screenshots or decorative UI elements
- `backend/static/icons/` — SVG/PNG icons (product, social, badges)
- `backend/static/illustrations/` — general illustrations (SVG preferred)
- `backend/static/motion/` — animated assets (Lottie JSON, SVG animations, short MP4/WebM)

Naming suggestions:
- lowercase, hyphen-separated
- include size for raster images (e.g., `hero-glow-1600w.webp`)
- keep SVGs optimized
